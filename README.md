# DiscordBot

This bot primarily obtains information from HLTV.org such as the important matches and the player statistics from those matches.

It also takes information from csgostats.gg to supply personal player information.

It then displays it to the user if asked for specifically.

I was able to do this using request-promise and cheerio.

Currently trying to add more miscellaneous features.
